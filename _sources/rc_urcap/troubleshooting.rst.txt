FAQs and troubleshooting

Note: For problems connected directly to one of the modules please
  refer to module tutorials.

I can connect to rc_visard's Web GUI but the sensor is not reachable
from URCap

Make sure that rc_visard and robot have a valid IP address in the same
network segment.

Can I connect multiple rc_visards to my robot

Currently it is not possible to work with multiple sensors connected
to a single robot.

I cannot install URCap

To install Roboception's URCap, the controller version has to be 3.7.0
or higher.

Is it possible to set the parameters of the rc_visard directly in UR
program?

It is possible to set

rc_visard

 parameters with the

rc_set_parameter

 Expert Function and Set Parameter common node.
