Hand-eye calibration

This tutorial guides you through the hand-eye calibration process with
Roboception's URCap. During this procedure, the spatial relationship
between the camera and the robot system is established.

The camera can be used in two ways: either statically mounted in the
workspace or attached directly to the robot. This choice determines
how the calibration is performed and the type of transformation
established. For detailed information on the calibration principles,
refer to the

Hand-eye calibration documentation

Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the tutorials

Static camera

In this configuration, the camera is mounted statically in the
workspace, and the calibration grid is attached to the robot. The
hand-eye calibration determines the transformation between the camera
and the robot base frame. Ensure the camera is mounted rigidly,
completely stable, and unaffected by robot movements or vibrations.

Mounting the calibration grid

The calibration grid can be easily and securely mounted to the robot
using the provided mounting adapter kit. The following steps guide you
through the mounting process.

Required tools and materials

T30 Torx driver

Torque wrench (capable of 4 Nm and 8 Nm)

Calibration grid mounting adapter

8 M6x16mm lens head T30 Torx screws


Mounting procedure

Attach grid to adapter:  Locate the four mounting holes in the upper-
right corner of the calibration grid  Mount the calibration grid to
the adapter using four M6x16mm screws  Tighten each screw to 4 Nm
using the torque wrench  If no torque wrench is available, hand-
tighten the screws carefully. Avoid over-tightening!

Mount adapter to robot:  Set wrist joint 3 of the robot to its neutral
position (0°), with the flange alignment hole pointing away from the
robot base  Select appropriate adapter orientation based on your
workspace constraints  Secure the adapter to the robot flange using
the remaining four M6x16mm flange screws  Tighten each screw to 8 Nm
using the torque wrench


Warning: Over-tightening the screws can bend the grid and impair
  calibration accuracy. Always use the specified torque values.

Note: The neutral flange position ensures maximum range of motion
  during calibration. While the adapter can be mounted in different
  orientations, consider your workspace constraints when choosing the
  mounting position.

End effector configuration

Before starting the calibration, the correct payload and Tool Center
Point (TCP) must be configured. A correct payload configuration
ensures precise robot positioning and makes the free drive mode more
responsive for teaching poses during calibration.

Navigate to Installation → General → TCP in the UR menu. Create a new
TCP with the name 'Calibration Grid'. An arbitrary TCP-transformation
could be used, but a zero-transformation is recommended such that the
TCP coincides with the tool flange.

Navigate to Installation → General → Payload in the UR menu. Use the
UR's built-in payload measurement function to determine the
calibration grid payload and apply the measured settings.

Click 'Save...' in the top bar → 'Save Installation as...' and name it
'Calibration Grid'.

Note: For more information on TCP and payload configuration, please
  refer to the official Universal Robots YouTube tutorial on

  .

Robot-mounted camera

In this configuration, the camera is mounted on the robot, while the
calibration grid is fixed in the workspace. The hand-eye calibration
determines the transformation between the camera and the TCP selected
during the calibration.

Warning: The transformation between the TCP and the camera will be
  used to compute object poses relative to the robot's base frame when
  triggering detections, using the robot's current pose. Therefore, it
  is crucial to

  use the same TCP during calibration and subsequent detection
  applications

  .

The camera must be mounted securely to the robot flange using
appropriate mounting hardware. The mounting must be rigid and stable,
free from any movement or play, and capable of withstanding robot
accelerations without shifting.

Mounting the calibration grid

Securely fixate the calibration grid in the workspace, ensuring it
remains immobile during calibration. Position the grid so it is
clearly visible to the camera and allows ample space for robot
movement.

End effector configuration

Mount the end effector required for your application.

Navigate to Installation → General → TCP in the UR menu. Verify that
the correct end-effector TCP is selected.

Navigate to Installation → General → Payload and use the built-in
payload measurement function to measure the complete payload
(including end effector and mounted camera).

Click 'Save...' → 'Save Installation as...' → name it 'Gripper with
Camera'.

Note: For more information on TCP and payload configuration, please
  refer to the official Universal Robots YouTube tutorial on

Using the hand-eye calibration program

The program is identical for both mounting configurations. It guides
the robot through a series of poses that have to be taught before.
During calibration, the robot moves with linear tool-space motion, a
tool speed of 0.5 m/s, and a tool acceleration of 0.5 m/s².

Step-by-step calibration

Create an empty program

Add the 'rc hand-eye calibration' program node

In the node, select your sensor and configure the mounting type and
grid size


For each of the eight 'Set pose' nodes:  Refer to the reference image
in the program node for guidance  Move the robot to achieve a similar
grid position in the live camera view  Click 'Store waypoint' button
once positioned


Execute the program at around 25% speed initially to react to
potential collisions.

After successful calibration:  Review the results in the 'Calibration
result' node  Store the calibration if error values are acceptable
(typically less than 2mm)


Note: While positioning the robot, use the free drive mode while
  remaining in the calibration pose node to adjust the position. This
  keeps the live view visible during adjustment. Consider using the
  constraint- free drive mode for easier positioning in certain cases.

Note: The reference images provided only serve as guidance. What is
  crucial is capturing eight distinctly different poses of the
  calibration grid.
