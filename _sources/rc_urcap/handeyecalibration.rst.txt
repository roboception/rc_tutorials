Hand-eye calibration

This tutorial guides you through the hand-eye calibration process with
Roboception's URCap. During this procedure, the spatial relationship
between the camera and the robot system is established.

The camera can be used in two ways: either statically mounted in the
workspace or attached directly to the robot. This choice determines
how the calibration is performed and the type of transformation
established. For detailed information on the calibration principles,
refer to the

Hand-eye calibration documentation

Static camera

In this configuration, the camera is mounted statically in the
workspace, and the calibration grid is attached to the robot. The
hand-eye calibration determines the transformation between the camera
and the robot base frame. Ensure the camera is mounted rigidly,
completely stable, and unaffected by robot movements or vibrations.

Mounting the calibration grid

The calibration grid includes has mounting holes in its upper-right
corner for attachment to the robot's flange. This location maximizes
the robot's range of motion during calibration. Secure the grid using
four M6 screws (16 mm length), ensuring it is firmly fixed. Tighten
each screw to exactly 4 Nm. The positioning hole in the robot flange
should face the middle of the calibration grid's shorter side for
proper alignment.

Warning: Over-tightening the screws can bend the grid and impair
  calibration accuracy. Use a torque wrench to apply the correct
  torque of 4 Nm.

Note: The grid's mounting position on the robot flange does not
  affect the calibration results, as the transformation between the
  grid and the flange is automatically calculated during the process.
  Using a mounting adapter (as shown in the calibration video) can
  provide significant advantages. It ensures that the robot's joint
  configuration during calibration closely matches its configuration
  during picking operations, thereby reducing the impact of robot
  kinematic inaccuracies. Additionally, the adapter allows the grid to
  be positioned farther from the camera system, increasing the usable
  workspace and enabling a more diverse range of calibration poses.


End effector configuration

Before starting the calibration, the correct payload and Tool Center
Point (TCP) must be configured. A correct payload configuration
ensures precise robot positioning and makes the free drive mode more
responsive for teaching poses during calibration.

Navigate to Installation → General → TCP in the UR menu. Create a new
TCP with the name 'Calibration Grid'. An arbitrary TCP-transformation
could be used, but a zero-transformation is recommended for an overlap
with the robot flange.

Navigate to Installation → General → Payload in the UR menu. Use the
UR's built-in payload measurement function to determine the
calibration grid payload and apply the measured settings.

Click 'Save...' in the top bar → 'Save Installation as...' and name it
'Calibration Grid'.

Note: For more information on TCP and payload configuration, please
  refer to the official Universal Robots YouTube tutorial on

  .

Robot-mounted camera

In this configuration, the camera is mounted on the robot, while the
calibration grid is fixed in the workspace. The hand-eye calibration
determines the transformation between the camera and the TCP selected
during the calibration.

Warning: The transformation between the TCP and the camera will be
  used to compute object poses relative to the robot's base frame when
  triggering detections, using the robot's current pose. Therefore, it
  is crucial to

  use the same TCP during calibration and subsequent detection
  applications

  .

The camera must be mounted securely to the robot flange using
appropriate mounting hardware. The mounting must be rigid and stable,
free from any movement or play, and capable of withstanding robot
accelerations without shifting.

Mounting the calibration grid

Securely fixate the calibration grid in the workspace, ensuring it
remains immobile during calibration. Position the grid so it is
clearly visible to the camera and allows ample space for robot
movement.

End effector configuration

Mount the end effector required for your application.

Navigate to Installation → General → TCP in the UR menu. Verify that
the correct end-effector TCP is selected.

Navigate to Installation → General → Payload and use the built-in
payload measurement function to measure the complete payload
(including end effector and mounted camera).

Click 'Save...' → 'Save Installation as...' → name it 'Gripper with
Camera'.

Using the hand-eye calibration program

The calibration process uses a program node that guides the robot
through a series of poses. During calibration, the robot moves with
linear tool-space motion, a tool speed of 0.5 m/s, and a tool
acceleration of 0.5 m/s².

For convenience, the checkbox 'Use Roboception TCP and payload' is
enabled by default. This setting assumes the calibration grid is
mounted directly to the robot flange. However:

For static camera: It is recommended to configure a tool center point
installation (because of the benefits in free drive mode) and disable
the checkbox.

For robot-mounted camera: This checkbox must be disabled, and a TCP
configuration and payload measurement is required.

Step-by-step calibration

Create an empty program

Add the 'rc hand-eye calibration' program node

In the node, select your sensor and configure the calibration
parameters (Setting parameters in the rc hand-eye calibration node)

For each of the eight 'Set pose' nodes:  Refer to the reference image
in the program node for guidance.  Move the robot to achieve a similar
grid position in the live camera view  Click 'Store pose' once
positioned

Execute the program at 10% speed initially to react to potential
collisions.

After successful calibration:  Review the results in the 'Calibration
result' node  Store the calibration if error values are acceptable
(typically less than 2mm)

Note: While positioning the robot, use the free drive mode while
  remaining in the calibration pose node to adjust the position. This
  keeps the live view visible during adjustment. Consider using the
  constraint- free drive mode for easier positioning in certain cases.

Note: The reference images provided only serve as guidance. What is
  crucial is capturing eight distinctly different poses of the
  calibration grid.
