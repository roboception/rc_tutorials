Hand-Eye Calibration

This tutorial shows how to calibrate the

rc_visard

 to the robot, in order to determine its position relative to the
robot base frame, using Roboception's URCap. The hand eye calibration
procedure is described in detail in the

Hand Eye Calibration documentation

.

Note: The calibration has to be performed every time the

  rc_visard

   is moved relative to the robot base.

Before we start

This tutorial assumes that the tutorials

Getting started

 and

Tuning of image parameters

 have been completed.

Externally mounted sensor - mounting the calibration grid

The calibration grid for Universal Robots is delivered with 4 holes in
the lower left-hand corner and can be mounted directly to the flange
of the robot with four M6 screws. The mounting point is not located in
the center of the grid in order to reduce the chance of collisions
with joint five during calibration movements. The grid should be
mounted firmly with the positioning hole pointing towards the middle
of the calibration grid in direction of the shorter side.


Sensor mounted on the robot - mounting the sensor

When using the sensor mounted on the robot, it has to be firmly
mounted to the flange. Before starting the calibration, the weight of
the TCP has to be updated in 'TCP configuration' and the calibration
grid has to be placed in a way that it is not moving during the
calibration.

Calibration program

The

rc_visard

 hand-eye calibration procedure is implemented as a program node.
During the procedure the robot will move linear in tool-space with
tool speed 0.5 m/s and tool acceleration 0.5 m/s2 between the poses
taught by the user. The poses will automatically be sent to the

rc_visard

, and the calculated camera pose in the robot base frame will be shown
in the 'Calibration result' node.

Note: The calibration result is not automatically stored on the

  rc_visard

  . It is the user's responsibility to check the error associated with
  the calibration under 'Calibration result' and store it, provided
  the error is acceptable.

By default, for the duration of the calibration program with external
camera, the TCP will be set to the middle of the flange, and the
payload will be set to the payload of the mounted calibration grid. If
the calibration grid is not mounted directly on the flange, or if it
is not the only mounted element, TCP and payload have to be set
accordingly in the installation node, and the checkbox 'Use
Roboception TCP and payload' in the main screen of calibration program
has to be un-checked. For the calibration with robot mounted sensor,
the user has to specify the payload in robot installation node prior
to the calibration procedure.

In order to start a new calibration procedure:

Create an empty program.

Add the 'RC calibration' program node.

Choose the sensor you want to calibrate and other calibration
parameters (see Calibration parameters)

Move the robot so that the grid is shown on the live view
corresponding to the grid image on the right (see Set pose) and click
the 'Store pose' button. Repeat this procedure for four poses.

Run the program.

When the popup informing about the success of the procedure is shown,
go to the 'Calibration result' node, check the calibration result and
click the 'Store calibration' button if the calibration should be
stored persistently (see Calibration result).
