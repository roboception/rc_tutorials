Getting started

Note: Roboception URCap is working with software 3.7.0 or newer. In
  case you are running an older software version, please update your
  controller (files can be downloaded from the UR website:

  https://www.universal-robots.com/download/

  )

Note: Roboception URCap is internally communicating with the daemon
  on port 49285. In the unlikely event that it causes a conflict with
  a URCap from a different vendor, please contact Roboception support.

Roboception’s ItemPick kit fot Universal Robots contains everything
required to calibrate the robot and the

rc_visard

 , and start your first program.

The kit consists of:

rc-visard 160 monochrome

rc_reason ItemPick module

Small calibration grid with pre-drilled mounting holes

Connectivity kit with 5m network cable and adequate power supply

Roboception’s URCap

Is it also possible to to include the

RandomDot Projector

 and the corresponding

rc_reason IOControl module

Software installation

Download the URCap from Roboception’s downland page

Copy the URCap file to a USB flash drive

Insert the drive into the USB port on the teach pendant or robot
controller

Add URCap in Polyscope

Reboot the controller


Connect the sensor

You can connect the

rc_visard

 directly to the ethernet port of the Universal Robot controller, or
through a network switch. During setup connecting via switch is
recommended as some parts of the

rc_visard

 interface are not fully duplicated in URCap and are only available
through the Web GUI . It might be necessary to use an external PC to
configure the

rc_visard

 or its software modules.

Detailed instructions about network setup can be found in

Connecting and configuring rc_visard to a network

 tutorial.

Connect the rc_visard to the same network as the robot controller

Enable networking in Polyscope

In the installation node, set the IP address of the rc_visard

Note: A link-local ip address might change after reboot, therefore,
  we recommended assigning a static ip address or dhcp a server for
  network configuration.
