Expert Functions

Functions can be added to the program with Universal Robots Advanced
Program Structure 'Script code'.

rc_set_parameter

This function can be used to set all rc_visard parameters. Parameters
set with this function are not saved and will not be available after
reboot.

Input

node_name - name of the node as described in rc_visard manual

parameter_name - name of the parameter that should be changed as
described in rc_visard manual

parameter_value - value of the parameter that should be changed as
described in rc_visard manual

Output

True if the parameter was successful, false otherwise.

rc_turn_on_projector

This function sets the rc_visards 'out_1' to 'ExposureAlternateActive'
mode.

Input

This function requires no input parameters.

Output

This function does not return anything.

rc_turn_off_projector

This function set the

rc_visard

's 'out_1' to 'Low' mode.

Input

This function requires no input parameters.

Output

This function does not return anything.

rc_trigger_compute_grasps

This function triggers the grasp computation thread.

Input

suc_length_m - length of the suction cup in meters

suc_width_m - width of the suction cup in meters

lc_id - id of the load carrier that should be used (use '-1' if no
load carrier should be used)

roi_id - id of the region of interest that should be used (use '-1' if
no region of interest should be used)

use_projector - whether or not the projector should be used during
grasp computation (boolean value)

Output

This function does not return anything.

is_grasp_available

This function checks if there are computed grasps available. The
'rc_trigger_compute_grasps' function has to be triggered prior.

Input

This function requires no input parameters.

Output

True if at least one grasp is available, false otherwise.

rc_assign_grasp

This function returns the pose of a single computed grasp in the robot
base coordinate system. The 'rc_trigger_compute_grasps' function has
to be triggered prior.

Input

This function requires no input parameters.

Output

This function returns the pose of the next available grasp. If no
grasp is available it returns p[0,0,0,0,0,0]
