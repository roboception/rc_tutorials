SilhouetteMatch

This tutorial shows how to use the SilhouetteMatch Module with
Roboception's URCap.

Before we start

This tutorials assumes that you are familiar with the

Generic rc_visard node

 and that a valid hand-eye calibration has been stored on the

rc_visard

 as described in

Hand-Eye Calibration

.

Overivew

The SilhouetteMatch functionality is available in the generic
rc_visard node. Please see

Generic rc_visard node

 in order to learn how to work with generic

rc_visard

 nodes.

The following functions are available for SilhouetteMatch:

DetectItems: Triggers detection of boxes

GetObjectPose: Gets the next pose after detection has been triggered

CalibratePlane: Starts the plane calibration

DetectItems


It is mandatory to choose the template that has to be detected. If
necessary enter a region of interest and offset, but it's not
mandatory.

GetObjectPose


This functions requires that DetectItems has been triggered before. It
returns the pose of the next available object that was detected and
stores the pose in PolyScope's variable format.

If no reachable template is matched and

Stop program when pose is not available

 checkbox is checked, popup will appear and the program will be
terminated. If the checkbox is not checked zero pose (p[0,0,0,0,0,0])
is returned.

Note: When the

  Stop program when pose is not available

   checkbox is unchecked, user has catch the case when nothing is
  detected (the zero pose (p[0,0,0,0,0,0]) is returned). If this
  situation is not handled, it might lead to collision or undefined
  robot behavior.

With the

'Pick approach angle'

 drop down menu it is possible to change the strategy of calculating
the angle of the returned position. There are three different options
to choose from:

Last pose orientation Detected orientation is ignored, instead the
orientation of the last waypoint is used.

Only RZ from detected pose For RZ detected orientation is used, RX and
RY are based on the last waypoint orientation.

Only RX, RY from detected pose For RX RY detected orientation is used,
RZ is based on the last waypoint orientation.

Detected pose orientation The complete detected orientation is used.

CalibratePlane


This function starts plane calibration procedure.
