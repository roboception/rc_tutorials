Getting started with CollisionCheck

The CollisionCheck module is integrated with the

ItemPick and BoxPick

 modules, with

SilhouetteMatch

, and with

CADMatch

, but can also be used as standalone product. In this tutorial we
focus on setting the parameters and checking collisions with the
ItemPick module.

Warning: Collisions are checked only between the load carrier and
  the gripper, not the robot itself, the flange, other objects or the
  item located in the robot gripper. Only in combination with

  SilhouetteMatch

   or

  CADMatch

   and only in case the selected template contains a collision
  geometry and "check_collisions_with_matches" is enabled in the
  respective detection module, also collisions between the gripper and
  other

  detected

   objects are checked. Collisions with objects that cannot be
  detected will not be checked.

Before we start

In order to go through this tutorial, the following prerequisites
should be met:

-[ The

rc_visard

 is properly configured: ]-

The rc_visard is running the latest firmware (version 22.07) and the
rc_visard's license includes the CollisionCheck and ItemPick modules.
This can be verified on the System ‣ Firmware & License page of the
Web GUI.

-[ The previous tutorial

Setting up the gripper

 has been completed. ]-

Note: The detection in the tutorial is done with the ItemPick
  module. To fully recreate it, it is necessary to have the ItemPick
  module available on the sensor and be able to run the detection as
  described in

  Configuring ItemPick for bin picking

  . However, reading it will give useful insights also for people who
  use it with other detection modules or as a standalone module.

Checking collisions

Note: To show the results of the CollisionCheck module, we will use
  the

  Try Out

   section of the Web GUI's Modules ‣ ItemPick page. More details on
  how to use CollisionCheck with other modules are available in their
  tutorials and the manual. For using CollisionCheck as a standalone
  product check the

  CollisionCheck

   manual.

After gripper and parameters are configured, filtering out the
colliding grasps is quite straight forward. In the

Try Out

 section of the Web GUI's Modules ‣ ItemPick page, define the suction
surface length and width corresponding to the real dimensions of the
gripper's suction cup. After that, select the load carrier and gripper
as shown in

Fig. 51

.

After clicking on the Detect Grasp Points button, only the collision-
free grasps are returned.


In the visualization images, the colliding grasps are drawn as red
points and black ellipses as shown in

Fig. 52

, but will not be listed in the 'Result of Grasp Point Detection'
table. To get all detected grasps, users should trigger a new
detection without selecting a gripper.


Setting a pre-grasp offset

The "pre_grasp_offset" argument on the Web GUI's Modules ‣ ItemPick
page can be used for additionally checking if the gripper is in
collision with the load carrier at any point during a linear motion
from the pre-grasp position to the grasp position. The pre-grasp
offset is the offset from the grasp position to the pre-grasp position
in the grasp's coordinate frame. If this value is set to (0,0,0),
collisions will only be checked at the grasp points.


Configuring parameters

The parameters for collision checking are set in the Web GUI's
Configuration ‣ CollisionCheck page or via the REST-API interface, no
matter if the module is used as a standalone product or as a part of
any rc_reason module. Details are given in the manual in

Parameter overview

.

Collision Distance

   The "collision_distance" parameter is the minimal distance in
   meters between any part of the gripper geometry and any of the load
   carrier’s walls for a grasp to be considered collision free.

   Fig. 54

    visualizes this distance. This parameter should be increased if
   the module returns valid grasps too close to the load carrier's
   walls. If, on the other hand, valid grasps near the load carrier's
   walls are rejected, this value should be decreased.


Check Flange

   The "check_flange" parameter is used to activate an additional
   safety check to prevent collisions between the load carrier and the
   robot body. If this check is active, grasps where any part of robot
   flange is inside the load carrier are marked as colliding. For this
   functionality to work properly it is necessary to correctly set the
   flange radius during the gripper creation (see

   Flange radius

   ).


Check Bottom

   When this check is enabled, the collisions will be checked not only
   with the side walls of the load carrier but also with its bottom.

   If the TCP of the gripper is inside the collision geometry (e.g.
   for suction cups), it might happen that the grasp points close to
   the load carrier bottom are marked as colliding. To prevent this
   from happening, collisions with the load carrier bottom can be
   disabled by setting the "check_bottom" parameter to false. This
   parameter should only be disabled if it is safe to assume that such
   collisions will not happen. We do not recommend to switch it off
   for large grippers that might collide with the bottom of the load
   carrier when they are tilted.

Troubleshooting

A grasp close to the bottom of the load carrier is marked as colliding
