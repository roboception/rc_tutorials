Obtain dense depth images with the RandomDot Projector

This tutorial shows how to set up the

rc_visard

 with the

RandomDot Projector

 to increase the density of depth images, as shown in

Fig. 11

. This is particularly recommended for objects and workspaces with
little or no visual texture.


Note: This tutorial assumes that the previous tutorial

  Tuning of Image Parameters

   has been completed.

Before we start

Before going through this tutorial, the following prerequisites should
be met.

The rc_visard's image version is at least 1.4 and the rc_visard's
license includes the IOControl component. This can be verified on the
Web GUI's System panel.

The RandomDot Projector, its Y-cable, and a 24 V, 60 W power supply
are available.

Warning: The

  rc_visard

   is operated with a 24 V, 30 W power supply which is not suitable
  for the

  rc_visard

   and RandomDot Projector combination. A stronger power supply with
  60 W must be used.

Note: The RandomDot Projector is controlled via the GPIO Out 1 of
  the

  rc_visard

   (cfr.

  IO and Projector Control

  ). In this tutorial, Out 1 mode refers to the RandomDot Projector
  mode.

Mounting the projector

The RandomDot Projector should be mounted as close as possible to the

rc_visard

 in order to avoid occlusions. When possible, we recommended to attach
the RandomDot Projector directly onto the

rc_visard

 using the mechanical adapter included in the delivery.

Once the RandomDot Projector has been mounted, it can be powered using
the Y-cable. The Y-cable must be connected to (1) the

rc_visard

 power and GPIO connector, (2) the RandomDot Projector power
connector, and (3) the power supply.


Focusing the projector

For the focus configuration, one should turn the RandomDot Projector
permanently on. This can be done on the Web GUI's

IOControl

 panel available in the

Modules

 tab by setting the Out 1 mode to

High

.

The focus is adjusted by rotating one of the rings of the lens until
the random dot pattern is sharp (

Fig. 13

).


Configuring the aperture of the projector

For the aperture configuration, one should set the Exposure mode to

Auto

 in the Web GUI's

Camera

 panel.

The aperture controls the brightness of the image with the random dot
pattern and is adjusted by rotating one of the rings of the lens.

For its configuration, one should look at the

Confidence

 image in the Web GUI's

Depth Image

 panel and reduce the aperture as much as possible, while still
achieving good confidence over the whole image (i.e. as much white
pixels as possible,

Fig. 14

).


Selecting the Out 1 mode

By default, the Out 1 mode of the

rc_visard

 is set to

ExposureActive

. This means that the RandomDot Projector is on only for the exposure
time of every image.

Typically, the user needs to select the

ExposureAlternateActive

 Out 1 mode, in which the RandomDot Projector is on only for the
exposure time of every second image. Images with projected pattern are
used for computing depth images. Images without projected pattern can
be used as texture or for other image processing modules.

This mode can be selected on the Web GUI's

IOControl

 panel.

Warning: The RandomDot Projector must not be turned on permanently
  during normal operation (Out 1 mode set to

  High

  ), since it may eventually start flickering to protect the projector
  from overheating.

Configuring the exposure

As last step, one needs to go back to the Web GUI's

Camera

 panel and set the exposure time as explained in the

Exposure and Gain Settings

 section of the

Tuning of Image Parameters

 tutorial.

Note: In

  ExposureAlternateActive

   mode, the auto exposure algorithm adjusts the exposure time by
  considering only camera images for which Out 1 is

  High

  . This means that the exposure time is optimized such that camera
  images with the random dot pattern are well-exposed.

Note: If the exposure is configured to automatic mode, when the
  projector is turned on, it may take a few seconds until the exposure
  and gain settings become stable.

More optimization tricks

In some cases, the density of the depth image can be further optimized
by changing the focus of the RandomDot Projector to introduce some
blur in the projected pattern. This can be done while looking at the

Confidence

 image in the Web GUI's

Depth Image

 panel and trying to obtain as much white pixels as possible.

If the camera image includes highlights that are not reconstructed in
the depth image (

Fig. 15

), one can verify whether these highlights are introduced by the
RandomDot Projector (e.g. by simply turning the projector off). In
such case, we recommend to change the mounting of the RandomDot
Projector, in order to have a different angle between the

rc_visard

 and the projector itself. Reducing the aperture of the projector can
also help in removing highlights.
