FAQs and troubleshooting

There are no grasps detected on the objects

   Do objects appear in the depth image? (an additional RandomDot
   projector might be needed)

   Do the workpieces appear in the depth image without holes? (cfr.
   Configuring image parameters)

   Are the workpieces inside the region of interest (if specified)?

   Is the load carrier detected (if specified)?

   Is the object smaller than the cluster_maximum_dimension value?

There are too many grasps on one single object

The "clustering_surface_max_rmse" and "cluster_maximum_curvature"
parameters should be increased.
