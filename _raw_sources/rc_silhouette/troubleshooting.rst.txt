FAQs and troubleshooting
========================

.. _silhouettematch-faq-base-plane-not-detected:
.. toggle-header::
   :header: **The base plane is not detected properly**

   .. toggle-header::
      :header: **AprilTag-based**

      * Is the angle between the |rc_visard|'s line of sight and the plane's normal at most 10 degrees?
      * Are at least three AprilTags of the "36h11" family visible in the left *and* right image?
      * Can the tags be detected with the regular AprilTag component
        (see :ref:`rcvisard:sect-tag-detection`)? If not, try with larger AprilTags.
      * Do the tags span a large triangle?
        See :ref:`AprilTag-based base-plane calibration<silhouettematch-base-plane-calib-apriltag>`.

   .. toggle-header::
      :header: **Stereo-based**

      * Is the angle between the |rc_visard|'s line of sight and the plane's normal at most 10 degrees?
      * Does the plane appear in the depth image?
        If not, follow :ref:`silhouettematch-image-params` for ensuring a dense depth image.
      * Is the base plane the most distant plane that appears in the depth image?
        If not, a ROI should be used to select the right plane,
        see :ref:`Stereo-based base-plane calibration<silhouettematch-base-plane-calib-stereo>`.

.. _silhouettematch-faq-object-not-detected:
.. toggle-header::
   :header: **An object is not detected properly**

   * Is the base-plane calibration (still) correct?
     The right visualization on the |webgui| shows the size of the template that is being
     tried to match.
     Does it match the actual size of the objects on the left visualization?

     .. figure:: ../images/silhouette/bad-base-plane-calib.jpg
        :width: 600px
        :align: center

        Top: The base-plane calibration is obviously wrong, since the size of the template (right)
        does not match the size of the objects on the left.
        Bottom: The size of the template matches the size of the objects.
   * Make sure that the projector is off or in *ExposureAlternateActive* mode during
     object detection.
   * Are all relevant edges detected in the image?
     See parameter :ref:`Edge Sensitivity<silhouettematch-edge-sensitivity>`.
   * Try to increase the parameter
     :ref:`Maximum Matching Distance<silhouettematch-maximum-matching-distance>`.
   * Try to decrease the parameter :ref:`Matching Percentile<silhouettematch-matching-percentile>`.

.. _silhouettematch-faq-timeout:
.. toggle-header::
   :header: **A timeout occurs**

   The error message indicates if the timeout occurred during matching or refinement:

   * The timeout occurred during matching:
      * Are noise edges detected?
        If so, decrease the parameter :ref:`Edge Sensitivity<silhouettematch-edge-sensitivity>`.
      * Try to decrease the parameter
        :ref:`Maximum Matching Distance<silhouettematch-maximum-matching-distance>`.
      * Try to increase the parameter
        :ref:`Matching Percentile<silhouettematch-matching-percentile>`.
      * Consider selecting a :ref:`region of interest<silhouettematch-roi>`.
      * Try with reduced :ref:`quality<silhouettematch-quality>`.
   * The timeout occurred during refinement:
      * Decrease the parameter :ref:`Maximum Object Number<silhouettematch-maximum-object-number>`.
      * Consider selecting a :ref:`region of interest<silhouettematch-roi>`.

.. _silhouettematch-faq-noise-edges:
.. toggle-header::
   :header: **A lot of noise edges are detected**:

   * Try to decrease the parameter :ref:`Edge Sensitivity<silhouettematch-edge-sensitivity>`.
   * Is the base-plane texture-less?
   * Make sure that the projector is off or in *ExposureAlternateActive* mode during
     object detection.
