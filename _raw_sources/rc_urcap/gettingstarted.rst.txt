Getting started
==================

.. note::

  |company|'s URCap is working with software 3.12.0 or newer for CB series, and 5.6.0 or newer for E-series. In case you are running an older software version, please update your controller (files can be downloaded from the UR website: https://www.universal-robots.com/download/)

.. note::
  |company|'s URCap is internally communicating with the daemon on port 49285. In the unlikely event that it causes a conflict with a URCap from a different vendor, please contact |company| support.

|company|'s ItemPick Bundle for Universal Robots contains everything required to calibrate the robot and the |rcvisard| , and start your first program. The bundle is sold in two versions: with or without a RandomDot Projector.

The basic bundle consists of:

* `rc_visard 160 monochrome <https://roboception.com/product/rc_visard-160-monochrome/>`_
* `rc_reason ItemPick Module <https://roboception.com/product/itempick/>`_
* `Small Calibration-Grid <https://roboception.com/product/calibrationgrid/>`_ with pre-drilled mounting holes
* `Connectivity Kit <https://roboception.com/product/connectivity-kit/>`_ with 5m network cable and 30W power supply

The kit including the projector consists of:

* `rc_visard 160 monochrome <https://roboception.com/product/rc_visard-160-monochrome/>`_
* `rc_reason ItemPick Module <https://roboception.com/product/itempick/>`_
* `Small Calibration-Grid <https://roboception.com/product/calibrationgrid/>`_ with pre-drilled mounting holes
* `Connectivity Kit <https://roboception.com/product/connectivity-kit/>`_ with 5m network cable and 60W power supply
* `RandomDot Projector <https://roboception.com/product/random-dot-projector/>`_
* `rc_reason IOControl Module <https://roboception.com/product/rc_reason-iocontrol/>`_


Software installation
---------------------
#. Download the URCap from `Roboception's download page <https://roboception.com/en/download/>`_

#. Copy the URCap file to a USB flash drive

#. Insert the USB drive into the USB port of the teach pendant or robot controller

#. On the Welcome screen of the PolyScope Robot User Interface press the Setup Robot button first and then press the URCaps Setup button

#. Click on the + button to install a new URCap application

#. Navigate to the rc_visard_urcap file by clicking on your USB drive and selecting it. Confirm the selection by clicking on Open

#. Reboot the controller

After rebooting the robot, the rc_visard_urcap application should be marked by a green tick in the URCaps Setup window (see :numref:`fig_successful_installed_urcap`).

Connect the sensor
-----------------------

You can connect the |rcvisard| directly to the ethernet port of the Universal Robot controller, or through a network switch. During setup, it is recommended to establish a connection via switch, since some parts of the |rcvisard| interface are not fully duplicated in URCap and are only available through the |webgui|. It might be necessary to use an external PC to configure the |rcvisard| or its software modules.

Detailed instructions about network setup can be found in :ref:`general-network` tutorial.

#. Connect the |rcvisard| to the same network as the robot controller
#. Enable networking in PolyScope
#. In the installation node, set the IP address of the |rcvisard|

.. note::
    A link-local IP address might change after reboot, therefore, we recommended assigning a static IP address or using a DHCP server for network configuration.
