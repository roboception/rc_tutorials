Getting started
==================

.. note::

  |company| URCap is working with software 3.7.0 or newer. In case you are running an older software version, please update your controller (files can be downloaded from the UR website: https://www.universal-robots.com/download/)

.. note::
  |company| URCap is internally communicating with the daemon on port 49285. In the unlikely event that it causes a conflict with a URCap from a different vendor, please contact |company| support.

|company|'s ItemPick kit fot Universal Robots contains everything required to calibrate the robot and the |rcvisard| , and start your first program.

The kit consists of:

* `rc-visard 160 monochrome <https://roboception.com/product/rc_visard-160-monochrome/>`_
* `rc_reason ItemPick module <https://roboception.com/product/itempick/>`_
* `Small calibration grid <https://roboception.com/product/calibrationgrid/>`_ with pre-drilled mounting holes
* `Connectivity kit <https://roboception.com/product/connectivity-kit/>`_ with 5m network cable and adequate power supply
* Roboception's URCap

Is it also possible to to include the `RandomDot Projector <https://roboception.com/product/random-dot-projector/>`_ and the corresponding `rc_reason IOControl module <https://roboception.com/product/rc_reason-iocontrol/>`_

Software installation
---------------------
#. Download the URCap from `Roboception's downland page <https://roboception.com/en/download/>`_

#. Copy the URCap file to a USB flash drive

#. Insert the drive into the USB port on the teach pendant or robot controller

#. Add URCap in Polyscope

Connect the sensor
-----------------------

You can connect the |rcvisard| directly to the ethernet port of the Universal Robot controller, or through a network switch. During setup connecting via switch is recommended as some parts of the |rcvisard| interface are not fully duplicated in URCap and are only available through the |webgui| . It might be necessary to use an external PC to configure the |rcvisard| or its software modules.

Detailed instructions about network setup can be found in :ref:`general-network` tutorial.

#. Connect the |rcvisard| to the same network as the robot controller
#. Enable networking in Polyscope
#. In the installation node, set the IP address of the |rcvisard|

.. note::
    A link-local ip address might change after reboot, therefore, we recommended assigning a static ip address or dhcp a server for network configuration.
