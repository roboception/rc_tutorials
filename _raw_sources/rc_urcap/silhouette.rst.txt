SilhouetteMatch
===================

This tutorial shows how to use the SilhouetteMatch Module with Roboception's URCap.

Before we start
---------------
This tutorials assumes that you are familiar with the :ref:`generic-rc-visard` and that a valid hand-eye calibration has been stored on the |rcvisard| as described in :ref:`ur-hand-eye`.

Overivew
------------
The SilhouetteMatch functionality is available in the generic rc_visard node. Please see :ref:`generic-rc-visard` in order to learn how to work with generic |rcvisard| nodes.

The following functions are available for SilhouetteMatch:

* **DetectItems:** Triggers detection of boxes

* **GetObjectPose:** Gets the next pose after detection has been triggered

* **CalibratePlane:** Starts the plane calibration


DetectItems
-----------

  :width: 800px
  :align: center


It is mandatory to choose the template that has to be detected. If necessary enter a region of interest and offset, but it's not mandatory.

GetObjectPose
----------------

.. figure:: ../images/urcap/sil_get_obj_pose.png
  :width: 800px
  :align: center

This functions requires that DetectItems has been triggered before. It returns the pose of the next available object that was detected and stores the pose in PolyScope's variable format.

If no reachable template is matched and **Stop program when pose is not available** checkbox is checked, popup will appear and the program will be terminated. If the checkbox is not checked zero pose (p[0,0,0,0,0,0]) is returned.

.. note::
  When the **Stop program when pose is not available** checkbox is unchecked, user has catch the case when nothing is detected (the zero pose (p[0,0,0,0,0,0]) is returned). If this situation is not handled, it might lead to collision or undefined robot behavior.

With the *'Pick approach angle'* drop down menu it is possible to change the strategy of calculating the angle of the returned position.
There are three different options to choose from:

* **Last pose orientation** Detected orientation is ignored, instead the orientation of the last waypoint is used.
* **Only RZ from detected pose** For RZ detected orientation is used, RX and RY are based on the last waypoint orientation.
* **Only RX, RY from detected pose** For RX RY detected orientation is used, RZ is based on the last waypoint orientation.
* **Detected pose orientation** The complete detected orientation is used.

CalibratePlane
-------------------

.. figure:: ../images/urcap/sil_calibrate_plane.png

This function starts plane calibration procedure.
