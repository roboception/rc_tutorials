FAQs and troubleshooting
========================

.. _collision-faq-grasp-bottom:

.. toggle-header::
   :header: **A grasp close to the bottom of the load carrier is marked as colliding**

   Try setting the ``check_bottom`` parameter to false as described in :ref:`collision_check_check_bottom`.

.. _collision-faq-complicated-gripper:

.. toggle-header::
  :header: **My gripper has elements that cannot be modeled in the Web GUI**

  The gripper creator in the |webgui| does not allow modeling rotations in the gripper elements.
  If it is required to add this kind of elements, the |restapi| interface can be used as described in :doc:`rcvisard:collisioncheck`.
