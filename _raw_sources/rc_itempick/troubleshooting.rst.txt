FAQs and troubleshooting
========================

.. _faq-itempick-no-grasps:
.. toggle-header::
   :header: **There are no grasps detected on the objects**

    * Do objects appear in the depth image? (an additional :ref:`rc_randomdot projector<general-projector>` might be needed)
    * Do the workpieces appear in the depth image without holes? (cfr. :ref:`itempick-getting-started-configure-image`)
    * Are the workpieces inside the region of interest (if specified)?
    * Is the load carrier detected (if specified)?
    * Is the object smaller than the ``cluster_maximum_dimension`` value?

.. _faq-itempick-too-many-grasps:
.. toggle-header::
   :header: **There are too many grasps on one single object**

   The ``clustering_surface_max_rmse`` and ``cluster_maximum_curvature`` parameters should be
   increased.
