.. _general-projector:

Obtain dense depth images with the |projector|
======================================================

This tutorial shows how to set up the |rcvisard| with the
`RandomDot Projector <https://roboception.com/product/random-dot-projector/>`_ to increase the
density of depth images, as shown in :numref:`fig-general-projector-compare`.
This is particularly recommended for objects and workspaces with little or no visual texture.

  A scene including objects without visual texture (i.e. the intensity of the image
  is uniform over the whole object) and the reconstructed depth image without |projector| (center)
  and with |projector| (right).

.. note::

    This tutorial assumes that the previous tutorial :ref:`general-tuning-image-parameters`
    has been completed.

.. _general-projector-before:

Before we start
---------------

Before going through this tutorial, the following prerequisites should be met.

#. The |rc_visard|'s image version is at least 1.4 and
   the |rc_visard|'s license includes the
   `IOControl component <https://roboception.com/product/rc_reason-iocontrol/>`_.
   This can be verified on the :ref:`sect-web-gui`'s *System* panel.


#. The |projector|, its Y-cable, and a 24 V, 60 W power supply are available.

.. warning::

  The |rcvisard| is operated with a 24 V, 30 W power supply which is not suitable for the
  |rcvisard| and |projector| combination. A stronger power supply with 60 W must be used.

.. NOTE Do not mention that our |projector| has a special version of
.. the electronics compared to the one sold by Effilux, since this tutorial refers only to the
.. projector that we sell

.. note::

    The |projector| is controlled via the GPIO Out 1 of the |rcvisard|
    (cfr. :ref:`sect-iocontrol`).
    In this tutorial, Out 1 mode refers to the |projector| mode.

.. _general-projector-mounting:

Mounting the projector
----------------------

The |projector| should be mounted as close as possible to the |rcvisard| in order to avoid
occlusions. When possible, we recommended to attach the |projector| directly onto the |rcvisard|
using the mechanical adapter included in the delivery.

Once the |projector| has been mounted, it can be powered using the Y-cable.
The Y-cable must be connected to (1) the |rcvisard| power and GPIO connector,
(2) the |projector| power connector, and (3) the power supply.

  Different possibilities for the mounting of the |projector|: side-by-side with the |rcvisard|
  (left) and directly onto the |rcvisard| (right).

.. _general-projector-focus:

Focusing the projector
----------------------

For the focus configuration, one should turn the |projector| permanently on.
This can be done on the |webgui|'s *IOControl* panel available in the *Modules* tab
by setting the Out 1 mode to *High*.

The focus is adjusted by rotating one of the rings of the lens until the random dot pattern is
sharp (:numref:`fig-general-projector-focus`).

.. _fig-general-projector-focus:
.. figure:: ../images/general/projector_focus.png
  :width: 100%
  :align: center

  Blurred (left) and sharp (right) random dot pattern.

.. _general-projector-aperture:

Configuring the aperture of the projector
-----------------------------------------

For the aperture configuration, one should set the Exposure mode to *Auto* in the |webgui|'s
*Camera* panel.

The aperture controls the brightness of the image with the random dot pattern and is adjusted
by rotating one of the rings of the lens.

For its configuration, one should look at the *Confidence* image in the |webgui|'s *Depth Image*
panel and reduce the aperture as much as possible, while still achieving good confidence over
the whole image (i.e. as much white pixels as possible, :numref:`fig-general-projector-aperture`).

.. _fig-general-projector-aperture:
.. figure:: ../images/general/projector_aperture.png
  :width: 80%
  :align: center

  Maximum (top) and optimal (bottom) aperture of the projector. The confidence images do not
  present significant differences.

.. _general-projector-out1-mode:

Selecting the Out 1 mode
------------------------

By default, the Out 1 mode of the |rcvisard| is set to *ExposureActive*. This means that the
|projector| is on only for the exposure time of every image.

Typically, the user needs to select the *ExposureAlternateActive* Out 1 mode, in which the
|projector| is on only for the exposure time of every second image. Images with projected
pattern are used for computing depth images. Images without projected pattern can be used
as texture or for other image processing modules.

This mode can be selected on the |webgui|'s *IOControl* panel.

.. warning::

  The |projector| must not be turned on permanently during normal operation (Out 1 mode set to
  *High*), since it may eventually start flickering to protect the projector from overheating.

.. _general-projector-exposure:

Configuring the exposure
------------------------

As last step, one needs to go back to the |webgui|'s *Camera* panel and set the exposure time as
explained in the :ref:`general-exposure-gain` section of the :ref:`general-tuning-image-parameters`
tutorial.

.. In case Out 1 mode is set to *ExposureAlternateActive*, it is important to verify the exposure
.. of both camera images with the random dot pattern and camera images without the pattern
.. (:numref:`fig-general-projector-exposure`).
.. To this purpose, Out 1 mode can be temporary set to *High* and *Low* to visualize only
.. images with and without the pattern respectively.
..
.. .. _fig-general-projector-exposure:
.. .. figure:: ../images/general/projector_exposure.png
..   :width: 100%
..   :align: center
..
..   Camera image with pattern (left) and without pattern (right) in
..   *ExposureAlternateActive* Out 1 mode.

.. note::

  In *ExposureAlternateActive* mode, the auto exposure algorithm adjusts the exposure time by
  considering only camera images for
  which Out 1 is *High*. This means that the exposure time is optimized such that camera images
  with the random dot pattern are well-exposed.

.. note::

  If the exposure is configured to automatic mode, when the projector is turned on, it may take
  a few seconds until the exposure and gain settings become stable.

.. _general-projector-tricks:

More optimization tricks
------------------------

In some cases, the density of the depth image can be further optimized by changing the focus of
the |projector| to introduce some blur in the projected pattern.
This can be done while looking at the *Confidence* image in the |webgui|'s *Depth Image*
panel and trying to obtain as much white pixels as possible.

If the camera image includes highlights that are not reconstructed in the depth image
(:numref:`fig-general-projector-highlights`), one can
verify whether these highlights are introduced by the |projector| (e.g. by simply turning the
projector off). In such case, we recommend to change the mounting of the |projector|,
in order to have a different angle between the |rcvisard| and the projector itself. Reducing the
aperture of the projector can also help in removing highlights.
