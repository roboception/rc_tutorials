Obtain dense depth images with the |projector|
======================================================

.. only:: roboception

  This tutorial shows how to set up the |rcvisard| with the
  `rc_randomdot projector <https://roboception.com/accessories-for-robot-vision-solutions/rc-randomdot-pattern-projector/>`_ to increase the
  density of depth images, as shown in :numref:`fig-general-projector-compare`.
  This is particularly recommended for objects and workspaces with little or no visual texture.

    This tutorial assumes that the previous tutorial :ref:`general-tuning-image-parameters`
    has been completed.

.. _general-projector-before:

Before we start
---------------

Before going through this tutorial, the following prerequisites should be met.

#. The |rc_visard| is running the latest firmware (version |rcvisard_version|)
   and the |rc_visard|'s license includes the IOControl module.
   This can be verified on the :menuselection:`System --> Firmware & License` page of the |webgui|.

#. The |projector|, the network cable connecting it to the |rc_visard|, and a
   24 V, 60 W power supply are available.

.. warning::

  Please ensure that a 24 V, 60 W power supply is used for powering
  the |rcvisard| and the |projector| together.

.. NOTE Do not mention that our |projector| has a special version of
.. the electronics compared to the one sold by Effilux, since this tutorial refers only to the
.. projector that we sell

.. note::

    The |projector| is controlled via the GPIO Out 1 of the |rcvisard|
    (see :ref:`sect-iocontrol`).
    In this tutorial, Out 1 mode refers to the |projector| mode.

.. _general-projector-mounting:

Mounting the projector
----------------------

Mounting the projector is described in detail in the projectorâ€™s manual. Please
see :doc:`rcprojector:installation`.

.. only:: roboception

  .. note::

      For projectors sold until 12/2020, the mounting instructions are available on the
      `Roboception website <https://roboception.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/202108_rc_randomdot_white_quickstart_guide_en.pdf>`_.

.. _general-projector-focus:

Focusing the projector
----------------------

For the focus configuration, one should turn the |projector| permanently on.
This can be done on the :menuselection:`Configuration --> IOControl` page of the |webgui|
by setting the Out 1 mode to *High*.

Before focusing the projector, one needs to remove the lens protection tube temporarily.
Please unscrew the lens protection tube patently, until the rings of the lens are visible.
Now, the focus can be adjusted by rotating one of the rings of the lens until
the random dot pattern is sharp (:numref:`fig-general-projector-focus`).

.. _fig-general-projector-focus:

.. _general-projector-aperture:

Configuring the projector brightness
------------------------------------

For tuning the projector brightness, one should set the Out 1 mode to
*ExposureAlternateActive* on the :menuselection:`Configuration --> IOControl` page of the |webgui|.
Next, on the **Camera** page, the exposure must be set to *Auto* and
the *Auto Exposure Mode* to *AdaptiveOut1*.

The text line under the live images on the **Camera** page now shows the *Out1
Reduction* value in percent. This value describes the reduction of brightness
of the image without projection as compared to the image with projection. The
value should be between 10% to 20%. If the value is outside this range, the
brightness of the projector should be adapted.

For adapting the projector brightness, the aperture ring of the projector
lens can be adjusted by rotating it.

After a basic adjustment, the darkest object that is possible in the application
should be placed in the field of view of the sensor. If the dark object is
not properly visible in the depth image on the **Depth Image** page of the |webgui|,
then the projector brightness must be increased, despite high reduction values.

.. For its configuration, one should look at the *Confidence* image in the |webgui|'s *Depth Image*
.. page and reduce the aperture as much as possible, while still achieving good confidence over
.. the whole image (i.e. as many white pixels as possible, :numref:`fig-general-projector-aperture`).

..   present significant differences.

.. _general-projector-out1-mode:

Selecting projector working mode
---------------------------------

Single shot mode
................

If the projector is used in combination with rc_reason modules (ItemPick, BoxPick or SilhouetteMatch),
it can work in a single shot mode.
This means that it will only be activated on demand when the module requests a new depth image.

This mode is enabled by setting the *Acquisition Mode* to *Single + Out1* in the **Depth Image**
page of the |webgui|.

Continuous mode
...............

If the projector has to be used in continuous mode (stereo matching is performed continuously without a trigger),
the proper Out 1 mode in the |webgui|'s :menuselection:`Configuration --> IOControl` page has to be set.

By default, the Out 1 mode of the |rcvisard| is set to *Low*, i.e. projector is off.

Typically, the user needs to select the *ExposureAlternateActive* Out 1 mode, in which the
|projector| is on only for the exposure time of every second image. Images with projected
pattern are used for computing depth images. Images without projected pattern can be used
as texture or for other image processing modules.

.. _general-projector-exposure:

Configuring the exposure
------------------------

As last step, one needs to go back to the |webgui|'s **Camera** page and set the exposure time,
either manually, as explained in the :ref:`general-exposure-gain` section of the :ref:`general-tuning-image-parameters` tutorial,
or automatically using the auto exposure.
In this case, the *Auto Exposure Mode* should be set to *AdaptiveOut1* to avoid over exposure due to the projector.

.. In case Out 1 mode is set to *ExposureAlternateActive*, it is important to verify the exposure
.. of both camera images with the random dot pattern and camera images without the pattern
.. (:numref:`fig-general-projector-exposure`).
.. To this purpose, Out 1 mode can be temporary set to *High* and *Low* to visualize only
.. images with and without the pattern respectively.
..

..   :width: 100%
..   :align: center
..
..   Camera image with pattern (left) and without pattern (right) in
..   *ExposureAlternateActive* Out 1 mode.

.. .. note::
..
..   In *ExposureAlternateActive* mode, the auto exposure algorithm adjusts the exposure time by
..   considering only camera images for
..   which Out 1 is *High*. This means that the exposure time is optimized such that camera images
..   with the random dot pattern are well-exposed.

.. note::

  If the exposure is configured to automatic mode, when the projector is turned on, it may take
  a few seconds until the exposure and gain settings become stable.

.. _general-projector-tricks:

More optimization tricks
------------------------

In some cases, the density of the depth image can be further optimized by changing the focus of
the |projector| to introduce some blur in the projected pattern.
This can be done while looking at the *Confidence* image in the |webgui|'s **Depth Image**
page and trying to obtain as many white pixels as possible.

If the camera image includes highlights that are not reconstructed in the depth image
(:numref:`fig-general-projector-highlights`), one can
verify whether these highlights are introduced by the |projector| (e.g. by simply turning the
projector off). In such cases, we recommend using the *Double-Shot* mode that is available
on the **Depth Image** page.

Alternatively, the mounting of the |projector| could be changed in order to have a different
angle between the |rcvisard| and the projector itself. Reducing the aperture of the projector
can also help in removing highlights.
